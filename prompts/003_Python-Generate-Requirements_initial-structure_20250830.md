# Prompt and Result: Python - Generate Requirements Initial Folder Structure

**Prompt (30 Aug 2025):**

In sas-studio-custom-steps, create a folder called Python - Generate Requirements and within it, create a dummy README.md with just the title of the custom step.  Also, create a subfolder called img with a dummy gif image, to enable this change to carry through to git.  Add a version to the README using semantic version standards and the README style found under /sas-studio-custom-steps/_template/README.md.

Git add ONLY these changes and commit ONLY to the current branch (58-python---generate....), with a message that you added initial folder structure.  Craft your git commit message as per standards, using this for reference: https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-commit-messages.

Finally, save this prompt and the results to a markdown file under py-sas-studio-build-tools/prompts, using the naming convention <Prompt_Number>_<Step_Name>_<Short_Description>_<timestamp>.md

**Result:**

- Created folder `Python - Generate Requirements` in `sas-studio-custom-steps`.
- Added a README.md with the title, version (0.1.0), and placeholder text, following the template style.
- Created an `img` subfolder with a dummy gif image (`dummy.gif`).
- Attempted to stage these files for git, but encountered: `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`.
- No commit was made due to the missing git repository context.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure you are in a valid git repository before running git commands.
- Once in a git repo, you can run:
  ```sh
  git add 'sas-studio-custom-steps/Python - Generate Requirements/README.md' 'sas-studio-custom-steps/Python - Generate Requirements/img/dummy.gif'
  git commit -m "feat(requirements): add initial folder structure for Python - Generate Requirements custom step"
  ```
