# Prompt and Result: Python - Generate Requirements Final Files and Commit

**Prompt (31 Aug 2025):**

A SAS program and a JSON components file have been generated for a future custom step (a low code UI component in SAS Studio) called Python - Generate Requirements.  Please run final  check of both files, ensure content, date last modified and version numbers of all files including README are proper, and then add them to the current open branch of the git repo this file is under. Commit messages using a professional standard, definitely ensuring you sign off with a -s tag, and then push to the currently open branch. 

Finally, save this prompt and the results to a markdown file under py-sas-studio-build-tools/prompts, using the naming convention <Prompt_Number>_<Step_Name>_<Short_Description>_<timestamp>.md (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

---

**Result:**

- Syntax check: No errors found in the SAS program.
- All files (SAS, JSON, README) have version 1.1.0 and last modified date 31AUG2025.
- Staged and committed the SAS program, UI JSON, and README to the current branch with a professional, signed-off commit message.
- Pushed the changes to the remote branch.
