# Prompt and Result: Python - Generate Requirements Finalize and Commit

**Prompt (31 Aug 2025):**

A SAS program has been generated for a future custom step called Python - Generate Requirements.  Please run final syntax check of SAS program, ensure version numbers are proper, and then add this to the current open branch of the git repo this file is under.  Ensure current README version and content aligns with same and add that too. Commit messages using a professional standard, and then push to the currently open branch. Include a signoff tag (-s) when committing messages.

Finally, save this prompt and the results to a markdown file under py-sas-studio-build-tools/prompts, using the naming convention <Prompt_Number>_<Step_Name>_<Short_Description>_<timestamp>.md (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

- Updated the README to version 1.1.0 and added a brief description matching the SAS program.
