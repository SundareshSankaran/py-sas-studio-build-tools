# Prompt and Result: Python - Switch Environments README Update

**Prompt (29 Aug 2025):**

The README.md file for Python - Create a Virtual Environment is a good example of what a README for a Custom Step should be.  Using that as a template, modify the README.md file for Python - Switch Environments, using Python - Switch Environments.sas and Python - Switch Environments components.json as context.  Overwrite the README file in Python - Switch Environments folder with your result.

Save this prompt and the results as a markdown file in the prompts folder within py-sas-studio-build-tools.  Use a naming convention of <Prompt_Number>_<Custom_Step_Name>_<short_description>_<timestamp>.md (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

**Result:**

The README.md for Python - Switch Environments was updated to follow the structure and clarity of the Create a Virtual Environment README, with content tailored to the Switch Environments custom step and its UI/logic. The new README includes a description, UI/parameters, requirements, installation/usage, background, and change log, and references the SAS and JSON configuration for accuracy.
