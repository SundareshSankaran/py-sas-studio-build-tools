**Prompt (1 Sep 2025):**

What can a git maintainer do when older versions of files come over in a pull request because they had changed original files in the meantime?

**Result:**

When a pull request (PR) contains older versions of files (i.e., the PR branch is behind or has diverged from the main branch), a git maintainer can take the following actions:

1. **Request the Contributor to Rebase or Merge:**
   - Ask the contributor to update their branch by rebasing onto the latest main branch or merging main into their branch. This will surface any conflicts and allow the contributor to resolve them before the PR is merged.
   - Example commands for the contributor:
     ```sh
     git fetch origin
     git checkout <feature-branch>
     git rebase origin/main
     # or
     git merge origin/main
     # Resolve any conflicts, then
     git push --force-with-lease  # for rebase
     # or
     git push  # for merge
     ```

2. **Manually Resolve Conflicts During Merge:**
   - If the maintainer has write access, they can pull the PR branch locally, merge or rebase it onto main, resolve conflicts, and push the updated branch.
   - This ensures the latest changes from main are preserved and the PR's changes are integrated cleanly.

3. **Use GitHub's Web Conflict Editor:**
   - If the PR can be updated via the GitHub UI, use the "Resolve conflicts" button to fix conflicts directly in the browser before merging.

4. **Communicate Clearly:**
   - Explain to the contributor why the update is needed (to avoid overwriting newer changes in main).
   - Encourage frequent syncing with main to minimize such issues in the future.

**Summary:**
- Always ensure the PR branch is up to date with the target branch before merging.
- Prefer the contributor to resolve conflicts, but maintainers can do so if needed.
- Never merge a PR that would overwrite newer changes with older file versions.
