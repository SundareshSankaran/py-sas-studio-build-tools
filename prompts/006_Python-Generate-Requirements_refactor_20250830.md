# Prompt and Result: Python - Generate Requirements.sas Refactor

**Prompt (30 Aug 2025):**

Your objective is to improve Python - Generate Requirements.sas.  Review Python - Create a Virtual Environment.sas and note the structure in which it lists out macros, any Python code that requires a block, and finally the execution code, also taking care to implement an error checking mechanism.  Use this layout (along with required additional macros) to improve Python - Generate Requirements.sas.  Modify the SAS program in place.

Finally, save this prompt and the results to a markdown file under py-sas-studio-build-tools/prompts, using the naming convention <Prompt_Number>_<Step_Name>_<Short_Description>_<timestamp>.md (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

**Result:**

- Refactored `Python - Generate Requirements.sas` to follow the structure and error handling style of `Python - Create a Virtual Environment.sas`.
- The new version clearly separates macro definitions, Python code blocks, error handling macros, and execution logic.
- Error flag and description macros are used for robust error reporting.
- The code is now easier to maintain and consistent with other custom steps.
